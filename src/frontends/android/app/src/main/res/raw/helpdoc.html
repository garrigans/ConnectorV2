<h1>Connector how to guide</h1>
    <p>
        Connector is a network diagnosis tool which is primarily focused on testing IKEv2 IPSEC VPN connections.
        The app is spilt into two main parts; A quick Success/Fail vpn connection test which encapsulates the miriad of
        Connectors sub functions and a network diagnosis/fault finding module. The diagnosis module allows
        users to explore various stages of a vpn connection to aid in fault finding, additional diagnostic
        functions are in development.
    </p>
<h2>Simple Test or Diagnostics</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Simple Test</h3>
                <p>
                    Best for non technical users or those who just want to see if a VPN connection is possible
                    from their current location or in their current network environment. The User is required
                    to setup a VPN profile to connect to the target VPN server, one such use case uses the VPN type of
                    IKEv2 Certificate + EAP (Username/Password). This closely resembles most IPSEC L2TP connection
                    configurations. The certificate is required to be manually installed on the android device.
                    This is due to restrictions imposed by the android operating system.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Diagnostics</h3>
                <p>
                    Can be used at any time to check a variety of network parameters and connectivity,
                    a VPN connection can also be tested from this module. It is intended to aid in fault finding.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<h2>Test Route</h2>
    <p>
        Uses a custom traceroute algorithm to mimmick a standard linux/MS traceroute command. It accepts
        either ipV4 or domain names to conduct the trace. Currently a trace route is not possible when
        attempting to conduct a trace over 3g/4g, in this case a straight ping is conducted.
    </p>
<h2>Test VPN</h2>
    <p>
        This is a UI to a strongSwan instance, users can manage VPN profiles and certificates. A VPN
        connection can be established through this module. The Simple Test module obfuscates this module
        to aid in simplicity. Users should use this module if they want to try different VPN configurations
        or aid in fault finding.
    </p>
<h2>IP Lookup</h2>
    <p>
        This module allows users to do a quick check on an ip address to discover its geolocation data.
        It is intended for this to increase from a geolocation grab to a geolocation + who is grab, which
        will result in more detailed information to aid in fault finding. Users may find this module useful
        in discovering why a route cannot be reached.
    </p>
<h2>Test Port Access</h2>
    <p>
        Users can test a specified adresses ports using this module. For example www.facebook.com:80 would
        result in OK, where as www.facebook.com:500 would result in FAIL. A full port scan module is
        planned for future releases.
